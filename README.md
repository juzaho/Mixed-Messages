# Mixed Messages CodeAcademy Portfolio Project
 In this project, I built a random message generator program that outputs 3 new random messages every time a user runs the program. My program showcases basic JavaScript syntax and programming concepts.

## General Information
The topic of this project is `Random Apocalyse`. Here I used different objects to represent aleatory Monsters, Objects and a basic Character Status, accompanied with "construction functions" that are in charge of putting together all the variables to create 3 unique sentences.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- GitHub (version control)
- Basic command usage (directory navigation)
- Marckdown (to write this inspiring README.md file)

## Usage
In order to contemplate these 3 exciting sentences, you first need to run the program on a NODE.js enviroment.  Once you achieve this, its just matter of typing `node main.js` in your bash terminal.

## Improvements
> ### Saturday, October 16 2021, 2:22am
>Today I started the project and made a lot of progress.
>I created an object containing most of the variations on the sentences, an article selector function perfectly and a not so working function that was supposed to return a  random item from a specific property list within the variables object.  

>### Saturday, October 16 2021, 5:32pm
>*"first commit"*  
>I started looking for documentation about JavaScript objects with the goal in mind of fixing or improving my randomItem function. It turns out that my function wasnt working because of a typo error at "length" method....

>### Saturday, October 16 2021, 6:32pm
>*"first working version"*  
>I made some important decisions. I removed the `variables` object because it became messy, and created individual objects for each relevant variable instead. I made some bug fixes and decided the progam was almost ready.

>### Saturday, October 16 2021, 9:32pm
>*"final product (up to future improvements)"*   
>I improved the `illness` method by fixing some issues that returned some undefined illness. Fixed some variable names.  
>I considered  this version of the project as a successfully  completed portfolio project.

This project was suggested by CodeAcademy with the goal of me getting into practice my JavaScript and Version Control habilities.
